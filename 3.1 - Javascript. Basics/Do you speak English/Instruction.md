### DESCRIPTION:

Given a string of arbitrary length with any ascii characters. Write a function to determine whether the string contains the whole word "English".

The order of characters is important -- a string "abcEnglishdef" is correct but "abcnEglishsef" is not correct.

Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "eNglisH" is also correct.

Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "English", false for it does not

If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!

## Task:

Given a non-negative integer, `3` for example, return a string with a murmur: `"1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep..."`. Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.
